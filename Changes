Revision history for CGI-Buffer

0.72	Fri Nov  7 11:03:55 EST 2014
	Added the info option to init
	Removed some unused modules, and defer loading others
	Removed Exporter and use vars, use our instead
	Separate the web and mobile caches

0.71	Wed Apr  2 16:50:48 EDT 2014
	Speed optimisation with some output

0.70	Fri 13 Dec 10:24:45 EST 2013
	Loop optimisation until complete for even smaller output
	Use Test::Tempdir to create the temporary files when testing
	# Use RegExp::List to consolidate some scans of the output
	Ensure logger isn't called after it's been destroyed since that
		would cause Log4Perl to say it hasn't been initialised
	Use $cobject->value() rather than $cache->get() to see if the
		object data is there as well. There were some false
		negatives
	Accept HTTP_TE as well as HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING
	Output parsing improvements courtesy of Regexp::List
	Use Test::Most instead of Test::More
	Support HTTP_RANGE as well as Range
	Added more JavaScript optimisations when optimise_level >= 2

0.69	Tue Apr  2 14:59:59 EDT 2013
	Bumped minimum version of CGI::Info, needed for Cygwin
	t/output.t: try harder to ensure the "to be tested" version of
		CGI::Buffer is tested

	_check_modified_since, fix in 0.68 was broken

0.68	Sat Feb  2 12:13:03 EST 2013
	Handle situation where not modified but Etag is different would
		generate 304
	Added generate_304 option (defaults to 1)
	Handle situation where IF_MODIFIED_SINCE isn't a valid date
	On some platforms (e.g. Cygwin) t/is_cached is failing, so
		added debugging to find out why

0.67	Sun Oct 21 23:00:13 EDT 2012
	Remove spaces after <body>.
	Fix removal of spaces between </head> and <body>.
	Better handling of no body, e.g. when redirecting using Location

0.66	Thu Oct 11 12:11:11 EDT 2012
	Add sanity check.

	Improved handling of cache errors

0.64	Mon Sep 24 17:08:15 EDT 2012
	Only store in the cache when status is 200

0.63	Sat Sep 22 18:45:27 EDT 2012
	Fixed t/is_cached.t for systems without CHI
	Sometimes 304 was not generated for when giving IF_MODIFIED_SINCE in
		scenarios were it could have been
	Amalgameted that 3 separate caches into one cache.
	Minor speed improvements

0.62	Wed Sep 19 10:09:53 BST 2012
	Added resilience to is_cached in case the age of the script can't be
		determined.

	Removed superflouous whitespace around the top of the document and
		in lists
	Added t/unused.t
	Remove spaces after <div>
	Remove spaces before </div>
	Simplified the cache key
	If the script has been modified since the value in IF_MODIFIED_SINCE
		don't return 304, since the output may have been changed
	If the script has been modified since the time it was stored in the cache
		don't return true from is_cached()
	Use the cookies to ensure that different states of the client are stored
		in different entries in the cache

0.59	Wed Aug  8 10:00:00 BST 2012
	t/is_cached: fix tests on systems without CHI

0.58	Tue Aug  7 12:40:03 BST 2012

	If get on the body fails, remove the corresponding headers from the
		cache

0.56	Tue Jul 24 13:45:57 BST 2012

	Fix bug where 307 wasn't sent if the first request set encoding to gzip
		and subsequent check didn't

0.46	Sat Jun  2 14:02:39 EDT 2012
	304 can be sent irrespective of the value of gzip - so check
		for both in the cache

0.45	Tue May 29 12:19:41 EDT 2012
	Honour Cache-Control: private
	Look at If-Modified-Since before If-None-Match to reduce etag

	Avoid 'Wide character in memGzip'
	Renamed set_options to init, but kept set_options as a synonym for
		legacy apps
	Allow a reference to be passed to init

0.39	Fri Apr 20 09:04:51 BST 2012

	Added tests that If-None-Match can generate 304 return status

0.38	Wed Apr 18 11:32:31 BST 2012
	Only do kwalitee test in author environment because it throws too
		many false positives
